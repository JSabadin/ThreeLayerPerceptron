# Three-Layer Perceptron with Backpropagation

This project implements a three-layer perceptron neural network using backpropagation for learning. The network was evaluated on three different datasets: XOR problem, Isolet dataset, and a dataset of suspicious sounds.

## XOR Problem

The XOR problem is a fundamental problem to validate the learning capability of a neural network. The network was trained to learn the XOR function, a basic step in understanding the learning dynamics of the network.

## Isolet Dataset

The Isolet Dataset contains spoken letter recognition data. The network was trained to classify the spoken letters, demonstrating its capability to handle high-dimensional data. The dataset is available here. This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

## Suspicious Sounds

The third dataset contains features of suspicious sounds, specifically the average Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of sound waves. This showcases the network's potential in audio signal processing and sound recognition tasks.
